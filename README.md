# ExPort

A personal online portfolio website.

## What's the reasoning behind this app?

Just to create smsall introduction website and additional information about current repos and spotify activity.

## What's needed? 

You need a spotify API client and secret. After it's put you need to set the key to the first/only user in the database and it should take spotify activity from that.

If you don't do that, the app will work, only without the spotify part.

## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
